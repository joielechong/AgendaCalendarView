14. how to delete items and refresh calendar
Hello, thanks in advance for your attention.

I would like to know how can i delete items and "inform" the adapter to erease the item. The issue is that if i use init again, it scrolls me all the way up to the beginning which is not cool at all.

when i use evenList.remove(event), it may be removed from the calendar, but there is not a way to reload the calendar to make it dissapear, unless you init the calendar again, but as i mentioned before, it will make you scroll up to the beginning.

Thanks for your help.
